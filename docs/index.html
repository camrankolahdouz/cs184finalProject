<h1 align="middle">Simulating a Liquid in 2-Dimensions</h1>
    <div class="padded">
        <p>Our goal is to realistically model the motion of liquids over time. We do this by utilizing a grid structure and measuring the incompressible fluid within each square. Our team members are Reid Johnson, Camran Kolahdouz-Isfahani, and Anna Pan.</p>

    <h2 align=""middle>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Motions within a liquid are much more complicated to model in principle and in execution than motions of a few solids, as many of the physical principles that govern them are inherently less linear, or at least, less naturally linearizable. It is even more complex to consider their compression, since it is not easy to extract this from a representation of particles or grid levels. We can avoid this by representing only incompressible fluid, and we can use a “grid” structure to account for and represent the amount of fluid in each grid square of our model at any given time step, making liberal use of conservation of mass to assume that the total amount of water in grid squares remains the same, which reduces the dimensionality of our problem significantly. Our overall goal in liquid simulation is to be able to semirealistically model the movements of a “typical” fluid, like water or oil, over time.<p/>
    <h2 align=""middle>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        <p>We will build this project roughly on top of the other projects from this class, and the triangle rasterizer we designed for Project 1 will be our base. This will work well for our two dimensional purposes, although we will need to add many functionalities to it, including adding at least a couple shapes other than triangles to internally represent and render a few simple two dimensional solids in the environment that our fluid can interact with. We will use a grid data structure to represent the amount of fluid in each square of a grid, and then render both the fluid and the surroundings (which will be stationary two dimensional solids) over time, using a technique informed by the Navier-Stokes equation to compute the forces on the liquid to account for each time step. We will have a “time step” button to be used essentially just like the other buttons of our Project 1 GUI. Our deliverables will mainly be composed of images of liquids in interesting motions. For example, we intend on simulating and rendering snapshots of wine at various stages of being poured into a glass, an image of turbulent water in a (very simple) bath, and an image of blood in water. Another image we will simulate is one of a large drop of water falling through a large triangle of pegs, laid out as in a Galton board. We will attempt to make a large enough triangle to use this image to test the limits of our simulation and show that it is much less accurate at the bottom where water is less concentrated. If there are problems we can fix and debug along the way that are conducive to the format, we intend to show images of larger and larger Galton boards as we document the progression of our model.</p>
        <p>Something we hope to accomplish is to effectively approximate the force of buoyancy (and gravity) for solids and incorporate it into our time step update. For example, we will produce an image of a heavy circle and a light circle starting from the top and bottom of a pool before sinking and floating, respectively. We also hope to be able to stitch together images into a video, including this last series of images, although none of us is familiar with any framework for doing so, so we may wait and see if we feel the animation aspect from Project 4 is conducive to it. There will also likely be many cosmetic options to polish off, including possibly incorporating strategies to render fluids “smoother” and perhaps with prettier gradients.</p>
    <h2 align=""middle>Schedule</h2>
        <p>Week of Monday April 13th: We will have completed the basics of the grid data structure. This involves picking the data structure, defining constructors, and other helper methods.</p>
        <p>Week of Monday April 20th: We will have rendered fluid from our grid data structure. Also we will implement any more shapes needed (besides just triangles). We will need to build off of our Project 1 rasterizer. </p>
        <p>Week of Monday April 27th: We will be implementing the basics of the fluid time step update. We will need to implement the Navier–Stokes equations. We may add an aspect of animation.</p>
        <p>Week of Monday May 4th: We will polish everything into a final product. We will choose images and make the renderings. We may need to spend a lot of time building particular scenes.</p>
    <h2 align=""middle>Resources</h2>
        <p>We are building off our own Project 1 code. This means we are also using the same computing platform, hardware and software resources as we used in Project 1.</p>
